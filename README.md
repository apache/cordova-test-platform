# cordova-test-platform

This repo contains the code for an [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org)
platform that allows you to build applications that target NOTHING. This
platform is purely for testing, although it is also a good resource to see the
minimum requirements to implement a new platform.

[Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) is a project of [The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org)

# How to Use This

This repository contains a reference implementation of Cordova's Platform API.
The Platform API defines interfaces for Cordova tooling to be able to create,
build/compile, run/emulate and clean Cordova projects targeted at a specific
platform. Core Cordova platforms such as cordova-android and cordova-ios
implement this API. This API is then used by tools such as cordova-cli and
cordova-lib when managing platform-specific actions in cross-platform Cordova
projects.
